This class component implements Aculab webRTC services in the React Native project and it is part of Aculab react-native sdk react-native-aculab-client. You can write a custom class that extends AcuMobCom class component and uses its state variables and methods.

Please visit the [Example App](https://github.com/aculab-com/AcuMobCom-Example) to see it being used in practice.

## Installation

### Install the package

Install react-native-aculab-client and react-native-webrtc.

```sh
npm install --save react-native-aculab-client react-native-webrtc
```

### Install pods for ios

``` node
npx pod-install
```

### Manually add DTMF method for android

Open your_project/node_modules/react-native-webrtc/android/src/main/java/com/oney/WebRTCModule/WebRTCModule.java and add the method below into class WebRTCModule.

If you skip this step, the Android platform will throw an error when sendDtmf is called.

``` java
@ReactMethod
public void peerConnectionSendDTMF(String tone, int duration, int interToneGap, int objectID) {
    PeerConnection pc = getPeerConnection(objectID);
    RtpSender sender = pc.getSenders().get(0);

    if (sender != null) {
        DtmfSender dtmfSender = sender.dtmf();
        dtmfSender.insertDtmf(tone, duration, interToneGap); //Here the timers are in ms
    }
}
```

### Add permissions

#### Android

yourProject/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

add the following permissions

``` xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

#### iOS

yourProject/ios/yourProject/info.plist

add the following permissions

``` xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>for video</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>for chat</string>
```

### Android SDK Version

Make sure that your minSdkVersion is 24 or higher

yourProject/android/app/gradle/build.gradle

## Usage - [Example App](https://github.com/aculab-com/AcuMobCom-Example)

### Use the package as a react native class component

```js
import {AcuMobCom} from 'react-native-aculab-client';

class YourClassComponent extends AcuMobCom {
  
  your code ...

}
```

#### Enter registration parameters in your class component

```tsx
<YourClassComponent
    webRTCAccessKey={'string'}
    webRTCToken={'string'}
    cloudRegionId={'string'}
    logLevel={number | 'string'}
    registerClientId={'string'}
/>
```

#### AcuMobCom parameters

| Parameter         | Type                  | Description                                                                               |
|--------------     |----------             |------------                                                                               |
| webRTCAccessKey   | string                | [WebRTC Access Key](https://cloud.aculab.com/home/webrtcsettings) for the cloud you are using                                              |
| webRTCToken       | string                | WebRTC Token returned by getToken function                                                |
| cloudRegionId     | string                | Specify the [cloud region ID](https://www.aculab.com/cloud/guides/cloud-regions/) in format 0-2-0                                               |
| logLevel          | string &#124; number  | value between 0 and 6 inclusive. 0 disables logging and 6 is the most detailed logging.   |
| registerClientId  | string                | Unique client ID for registration                                                         |

## Workflow

### 1. Obtain [WebRTC Token](https://github.com/aculab-com/react-native-aculab-client/blob/431df94932dee1adc65a07d6517b1f5328098885/src/AcuMobCom.ts#L9)

### 2. Use WebRTC Token to [register](https://github.com/aculab-com/react-native-aculab-client/blob/431df94932dee1adc65a07d6517b1f5328098885/src/AcuMobCom.ts#L84) a client id

### 3. If registration is successful you obtain a client object and AcuMobCom can be used to its full extent

**NOTE: that registration can only occur when the callState is 'idle'.**

**NOTE: In production the apiAccessKey should stay secret, therefore the WebRTC Token should be obtained by your server and passed to your app for registration.**

Use state **callState** as indication of current state.

#### Call Client

1. set state callClientId to client ID you want to call
2. call callClient method

**NOTE: In order to successfully call between clients, they must be registered under the same Aculab Cloud Username. For Example user 'Anna123' registered under Cloud Username 'blue.star@company.com' can call 'Tom123' if 'Tom123' is registered under Cloud Username 'blue.star@company.com'. If 'Tom123' is registered under Cloud Username 'green.star@company.com' the call will always fail.**

#### Call Service

1. set state serviceName to service ID you want to call
2. call callService method

**NOTE: In order to successfully call service, the user calling the service must be registered under the same Aculab Cloud Username as the service. For Example user 'Anna123' registered under Cloud Username 'blue.star@company.com' can call inbound service 'current-time' registered under Cloud Username 'blue.star@company.com'. If 'Anna123' would register under Cloud Username 'green.star@company.com' the call to the service will always fail.**

- More information about inbound and outbound service can be found [here](https://www.aculab.com/cloud/guides/outbound-and-inbound-services/).
- More information about REST and UAS API service can be found [here](https://www.aculab.com/cloud/guides/which-api-is-appropriate-for-me/).
- The AcuMobCom package uses aculab-webrtc interface, you can see details about the interface [here](https://www.aculab.com/cloud/webrtc-interface/version-3/).
